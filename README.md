# config-files

These are my config files. I've been using Gnome since a lot of years, but with always the "find my ultimate env quest". I tried many desktop envs, with a favor for I3 but I found some limitation very frustating, and at the end I returned to Gnome. 

Lately, I wanted to try again, but this time with Awesome.

Desktop env : Awesome WM  
compositor:
